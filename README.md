## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure the following tools and services are installed and configured:

---

### 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18+ recommended  
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js  
- **MongoDB**:  
  - Local instance for development  
  - MongoDB Atlas for production or remote testing

---

### 🌍 Global Tools

- **nodemon**: For hot-reloading during backend development  
  ```bash
  npm install -g nodemon
  ```

---

### 🌐 Environment Configuration

Set up your environment variables for both backend and frontend by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in your credentials.

---

### 🛠️ Backend .env

```env
# MongoDB connection string (replace <username> and <password>)
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/event-db

# JWT secret key for admin authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Email credentials for sending confirmation emails
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
```

---

### 🖥️ Frontend .env

```


---

# 🌄 Image Uploads with Cloudinary Integration

This App supports robust, production-grade image handling via [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), enabling persistent storage, secure delivery, and seamless deletion for uploaded images.

---

## ⚙️ How It's Implemented

- **Cloudinary Setup:**  
  A Cloudinary account was created and credentials added to `.env`:
  ```env
  CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
  CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
  CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
  ```
 
# 🌩️ Middleware Configuration

The backend includes a `cloudinary.js` config file and a **Multer + Cloudinary middleware** for handling image uploads.

---

## 📦 Dependencies Used

```js
import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary';
import { CloudinaryStorage } from 'multer-storage-cloudinary';
import multer from 'multer';

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

const storage = new CloudinaryStorage({
  cloudinary,
  params: {
    folder: '', //set automatically uploads in this repo
    allowed_formats: ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png'],
  },
});

export const upload = multer({ storage });
```

# 🔗 Route Integration: Image Upload with Cloudinary

During **event creation**, image files are uploaded via Multer and stored as secure **Cloudinary URLs**.

---

## 📤 Upload Route Setup

```js
router.post('/create', upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
  const imageUrl = req.file.path;
  // Save imageUrl to MongoDB along with other event data
});
```
# 🗑️ Secure Deletion: Cloudinary Image Removal

When an event is deleted, its associated image is removed from Cloudinary using the stored `public_id`.

---

## 🔧 Cloudinary Deletion Method

```js
// Handle banner removal
    if (req.body.removeBanner === 'true' && event.bannerPath) {
      const imagePath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'uploads', event.bannerPath);
      fs.unlink(imagePath, (err) => {
        if (err) console.warn('Failed to delete banner:', err.message);
      });
      updatedData.bannerPath = '';
    }
```



# 🛡️ Benefits of Using Cloudinary for Image Management

---

## 📈 Advantages

- 🗂️ **Persistent Image Hosting**  
  Hosted images remain accessible long-term via secure URLs  
  with built-in **CDN caching** for global performance.

- ✨ **Automatic Optimization**  
  Cloudinary resizes and formats images automatically  
  based on device, viewport, and delivery context.

- 🧹 **Secure Image Deletion**  
  Removal is handled via `cloudinary.uploader.destroy(publicId)`  
  for precise and authenticated cleanup.

- 📦 **Simplified Deployment**  
  No need for manual uploads folder —  
  images are stored externally and accessed via Cloudinary URLs.

---

## 💡 Tip

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to **validate image inputs** on both the **frontend and backend**:
> - 🔍 Check **file type** (e.g., JPG, PNG)
> - 📏 Enforce **file size limits**
> - 🚫 Handle **upload errors gracefully**

---

## 🔐 Admin Access

Admins have elevated privileges and can:

- 📅 Create, edit, and delete events  
- 📋 View registrants and export lists (CSV)  
- 💬 Manage feedback and reviews  
- ✅ Verify feedback for homepage display  
- 📨 View messages and contact submissions  
- 🧑‍💼 Add other admins (only existing admins can do this)  

⚠️ **Admins cannot be created via public registration.**  
Only a registered admin can promote another user to admin status.

---

### 🧭 Admin Login

To log in as an admin, you must:

- ✅ Be registered as a user  
- ✅ Have been granted admin privileges by an existing admin  
- 🔐 Provide your User ID and Password on the admin login screen

---

### 🧪 Optional: Seed Admin (for Development)

To bootstrap the system with an initial admin, manually insert a user with `role: "admin"` into your MongoDB database.

📦 **Example Document** (MongoDB shell or Compass):

```json
{
  "name": "Super Admin",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "hashed_password",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

⚠️ Make sure the password is **hashed using bcrypt** before inserting.

---

## 👥 User Access

Regular users can:

- 🔍 View all public events  
- 📄 See event details  
- 📝 Register for events  

🚫 Users **cannot** access admin routes or dashboards.

## 📦 Deployment Instructions (To Deploy Frontend and Backend with different different url)

This project is deployed using **Render**, which supports both static frontend hosting and backend services with environment variables.

---

### 🚀 Backend Deployment (Express + MongoDB)

#### ✅ Steps:

- Go to **Render Dashboard**  
- Click **“New Web Service”**  
- Connect your GitHub repo and select the `server/` folder  
- Set the following build and start commands:

```bash
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm run start
```

- Add the required environment variables:
  - `MONGO_URI`
  - `JWT_SECRET`
  - `EMAIL_USER`
  - `EMAIL_PASS`

- Choose a free or paid plan and deploy

🔁 Render will **auto-redeploy** on every push to the selected branch.

---

### 🌐 Frontend Deployment (Vite + React)

#### ✅ Steps:

- Go to **Render Dashboard**  
- Click **“New Static Site”**  
- Connect your GitHub repo and select the `client/` folder  
- Set the following build and publish settings:

```bash
Build Command: npm run build
Publish Directory: dist
```

- Add the required environment variable:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
```

---

# 📦 Deployment Instructions (Unified Frontend & Backend on a Single URL)

This approach merges your **React (Vite)** frontend with your **Express + MongoDB** backend, hosted together under one Render service.  
Ideal for seamless SPA routing, simplified API access, and persistent cloud image storage.

---

## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Setup

Before deploying to Render, build your frontend locally and prepare it for server-side serving:

### 1. Build the frontend

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

- After successful build, move the dist folder to the backend directory:

```bash
mv dist ../server/
```

- Confirm that your Express server is configured to serve static assets:

```bash
// server/index.js
import path from 'path';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.use(express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')));

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
});
```


# 🚀 Deployment on Render

- Go to the Render Dashboard  
- Click “New Web Service”  
- Select the `server/` directory as your root deploy folder  
- Configure deployment settings:  
  ```bash
  Build Command: npm install
  Start Command: npm run dev
  ```

- Add the following environment variables:

```env
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
EMAIL_USER=your-email-username
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
PORT=10000
```
- Choose a plan (free or paid) and deploy!  
✅ Render will automatically redeploy your service on each push to the connected branch.

---

# 🧠 Notes

- No need for `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in this setup, as your frontend and backend share the same domain. But adding this will be easy. 
- Ensure your server uses fallback routing to support SPA navigation via direct links.  
- You can customize the deployment port with the `PORT` environment variable, commonly set to `10000` or Render’s default.

---


- Deploy and test

---

### 🧪 Post-Deploy Checklist

- ✅ Test all routes and endpoints  
- ✅ Verify email confirmation works  
- ✅ Check admin login and dashboard access  
- ✅ Confirm public event registration flow  
- ✅ Validate CORS and API connectivity between frontend and backend
